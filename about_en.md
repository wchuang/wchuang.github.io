I'm Frank from Taiwan, as an Sr. iOS Engineer @ByteDance in Shanghai now.

And I had been worked in 17Live(Taiwan), DiDi Chuxing(Beijing) and Farfetch(Shanghai) in my past recent career.

I'm keen on researching the knowledge how to be implemented on iOS foundation framework, e.g. NSAutoreleasePool or weak_table, and design patterns of MVVM, MVC, Decorator, Facade and SOLID principle, and launch performance improvement, UI rendering performance on APP. 

Currently, I'm working an iOS open source project personally, it's about APM framework writed in Swift with the slow development efficiency, because of I'm working it after my work.

Nice to meet you, and welcome to add/follow me on my social media. :)
