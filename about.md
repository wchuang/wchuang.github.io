I'm Frank from Taiwan, and I had been worked in DiDi Chuxing as an Sr. IM iOS engineer in Beijing, China.

As an iOS mobile developer over than 10 years experience(start in 2010), and almost 15 years of software development experience. I like Objective-C, Swift, Node.js, I also love Cocoa framework and its design patterns on iOS.

I'm keen on researching the knowledge how to be implemented on iOS foundation framework, e.g. NSAutoreleasePool or weak_table, and summarize the points to my personal blog website on Github. I also familiar with design patterns of MVVM, MVC, Decorator, Facade and SOLID principle and implement them on projects, e.g. IM system side project and PaymentSDK.

I’m well versed in improving the launching performance and UI rendering performance on APP. I had leading the iOS team in PChome Inc, and using Scrum to manage daily works, estimate story points and plan tasks every sprint. I also had developed some projects by myself like Pi 拍錢包 or IM system side project.
